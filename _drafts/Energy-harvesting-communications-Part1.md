**Smart RF energy harvesting communications: challenges and opportunities**

However, RFH efficiency is scarce due to low RF-to-DC conversion efficiency and
receiver sensitivity.

**A general utility optimization framework for energy-harvesting-based wireless communications**

**Application of smart antenna technologies in simultaneous wireless information and power transfer**

1891年第一次实现，但是不常用因为：path loss and RF-DC efficiency， 而且设备本身功耗比较大
最近比较火，是因为: WSN 发展迅速，且不方便换电池，如今的器件都是低功耗
